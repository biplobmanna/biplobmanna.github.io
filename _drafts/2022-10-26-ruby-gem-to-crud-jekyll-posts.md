## Summary

- Why not just create a Gem to do what the bash script 'create_post' does?
- Then, I could publish the Gem as FOSS
- This will serve 4 purposes:
  1. Give me experience with Ruby
  2. Give me experience with FOSS
  3. Bring me a sprinkle of notoriety
  4. Give me something to do once GATE is over

## How should I go about doing this?

1. Search all the features of Jekyll Posts
2. List all features which can be abstracted out
3. Create a layout plan
4. Code it out
