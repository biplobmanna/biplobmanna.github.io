## Why Obsidian?

I've tried building a knowledge bank using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) but notion is an overkill for my needs - it's choke full of features that I won't use, it requires me to spend a whole lot of time to create a dashboard(which I did for a specific usecase,) and most importantly, it's seriously slow and is mostly online. I tried the whole notion thing after being pseudo-influenced by YouTubers to some extent, but frankly I couldn't sustain the habit due to its effort requirements.

As an alternative, I needed something simple yet was powerful enough to be a knowledge bank. This led me down the rabbit-hole of zettlekasten and then onto [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It's FOSS. It uses Markdown to write notes, which I'm really comfortable using. It's simple and hassle-free to setup. And, most importantly, it's fast and offline.
