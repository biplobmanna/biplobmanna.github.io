Lately I've been procrastinating too much, so I've decided on a new way to reduce the time waste and get on with all the pending side projects. To do that, I adopted a sure-shot (we shall see!) way to get some code written. __Let's code to pass time.__

Instead of Netflix, PrimeVideo, or YouTube, whenever I get some free time, I shall work on either my blog or one of the innumerable side projects I've started but not gone anywhere. That seems like a good idea.

I'm on my 3rd day of implementation of said tactic, and so far it's been a moderate success. Whenever I have a small unit of free time, I work on my blog, and if I have some extended time on my hand, I will work on a new project that I have recently started.

The new project is something I shall blog about soon, so stay tuned. 

Until next time, <br>
