It was incredibly intimidating to setup Jekyll & Github Pages for the blog. I went through multiple iterations while trying to set it up correctly, amidst which I ended up deleting it twice, fumbled with the configurations inside `_config` thrice, and scratched my head four times.

But, finally, the blog is up. Right now, there isn't much to see, or to read, but hopefully soon, incrementally so, I shall be updating this blog. There should me more useless miscellaneous rants about what I failed at, so stay tuned.

Let's end this first blog post here. Short and bitter?

Until next time, <br>
